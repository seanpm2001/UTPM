# UTPM

## Untrusted Platform Module

An emulation tool for disabling and replacing TPM and allowing open source to continue, without abusive technology

## Emulation modes

- UTPM 1.2 (Emulates TPM 1.2)

- UTPM 2.0 (Emulates TPM 2.0)

## Detection hiding

To prevent a program from detecting UTPM and blocking out innocent users, there will need to be a way to hide the software. 

## Anti-TPM

Every installation or positive mention of UTPM provides an increase to a counter-revolution against TPM ("Trusted" Platform module)
